# Extracts the BuildKit-native SLSA provenance attestation from a pushed
# image and writes provenance.slsa.json.
#
# Uses `docker buildx imagetools inspect`, NOT `cosign download attestation`.
# docker/build-push-action's `provenance`/`sbom` inputs create BuildKit-
# native attestations (manifests attached to the image's own index /
# referrers), a different format from what cosign's `download attestation`
# expects — that command targets attestations cosign itself created via
# `cosign attest`. cosign cannot see BuildKit-native attestations at all,
# regardless of --predicate-type filtering or build caching — confirmed
# after two earlier fix attempts (matching the v0.2 predicate, then
# dropping the GHA cache backend per moby/buildkit#4501) both left "found
# no attestations" completely unchanged. `imagetools inspect` works for
# both single- and multi-platform pushed images.
