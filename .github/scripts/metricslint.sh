# Runs platform-gincommon's metricslint (the Enterprise Platform Observability
# Standard's own linter, version pinned by go.mod) against this service.
# Same three steps as iam-org-membership's script of the same name:
#
#   1. check: a real /metrics scrape from the production registration order
#      (TestStandard_ProductionRegistrationOrder, which records a sample on
#      every collector so every label set is validated).
#   2. refs:  alert rules, dashboards and runbooks under deploy/ and docs/ —
#      legacy or unregistered metric names.
#   3. inventory drift: docs/observability/metric-registry.md must match what
#      .github/scripts/metrics-inventory.py renders from the registry and the
#      scrape. METRICS_INVENTORY_WRITE=1 rewrites it instead
#      (`make metrics-inventory`).
